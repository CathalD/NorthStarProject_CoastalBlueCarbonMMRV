NO_ACTION,No Action (Baseline),Maintain current condition with no intervention - baseline scenario for additionality calculations,all,0,0,Used as comparison for all other scenarios. Zero cost and immediate effect.
RESTORE_HYDRO,Restore Tidal Hydrology,"Remove or breach dikes, restore tidal channels, reconnect historic flow patterns. Major engineering intervention.",salt_marsh;tidal_flat;mudflat,15000,2,"High cost due to earthworks, culverts, and monitoring. 2 years to establish stable hydrology before vegetation response."
PLANT_NATIVE_MARSH,Plant Native Marsh Species,"Plant native salt marsh species (Salicornia, Distichlis, Carex). Includes site preparation, planting, and initial maintenance.",salt_marsh;transitional_marsh,8000,3,"Medium cost. Includes seedlings, labor, and 2-year maintenance. Full canopy closure by year 3."
PLANT_SEAGRASS,Plant Seagrass Meadows,"Transplant eelgrass (Zostera marina) shoots or broadcast seeds. Requires suitable depth and light conditions.",seagrass;subtidal,12000,4,"High cost due to underwater work and high initial mortality. Requires 4 years to establish dense meadow."
REMOVE_INVASIVE,Remove Invasive Species,"Control invasive species (Spartina alterniflora, Phragmites australis). Mechanical removal or targeted herbicide application.",salt_marsh;transitional_marsh,5000,1,"Low-medium cost. Rapid effect (1 year) but may require repeated treatments. Enables native recovery."
THIN_FOREST,Thin Forest Canopy,"Selective thinning of forest canopy to reduce shading and promote understory vegetation. Targets areas with encroaching upland species.",forested_wetland;transitional_forest,3000,1,"Low cost. Immediate effect on light availability. Promotes herbaceous layer carbon accumulation."
GRAZE_ROTATIONAL,Implement Rotational Grazing,"Managed livestock grazing with 6-month rest periods. Prevents woody encroachment while maintaining herbaceous productivity.",salt_marsh;transitional_marsh,2000,2,"Low cost (fence installation + management). Takes 2 years to establish rotation pattern and vegetation response."
CEASE_MOWING,Cease Mowing/Haying,"Halt regular mowing or haying operations. Allows natural vegetation succession and soil carbon accumulation.",salt_marsh;meadow,500,1,"Very low cost (just monitoring). Rapid effect - vegetation responds within one growing season."
ADD_SEDIMENT,Beneficial Sediment Placement,"Import clean sediment to raise marsh surface elevation. Enhances flood resilience and carbon burial capacity.",salt_marsh;tidal_flat,20000,3,"Very high cost due to sediment sourcing and transport. Takes 3 years for vegetation to colonize new substrate."
RECONNECT_CHANNEL,Restore Channel Networks,"Re-establish historic tidal channel networks. Improves drainage, sediment delivery, and habitat connectivity.",salt_marsh;tidal_flat,10000,2,"Medium-high cost. Requires hydrological modeling and precise excavation. 2 years to stabilize."
REMOVE_FILL,Remove Historic Fill,"Excavate and remove historic fill material to restore original grade. Allows tidal inundation and wetland vegetation.",degraded_marsh;filled_wetland,18000,3,"High cost due to excavation and disposal. Takes 3 years for soil processes to re-establish."
BREACH_ROADWAY,Breach Roadway/Berm,"Remove sections of roadway or constructed berm blocking tidal flow. Partial restoration with infrastructure considerations.",salt_marsh;impounded_marsh,25000,2,"Very high cost due to engineering and permitting. Immediate hydrological effect but vegetation lags 2 years."
INSTALL_RUNNELS,Install Tidal Runnels,"Create small drainage channels to improve tidal exchange in waterlogged areas. Low-impact intervention.",salt_marsh;transitional_marsh,4000,1,"Low-medium cost. Quick effect on drainage (1 year). Promotes aerobic soil conditions."
NUTRIENT_MANAGE,Reduce Nutrient Loading,"Implement practices to reduce nutrient inputs from adjacent agriculture. May include buffer strips or bioreactors.",salt_marsh;estuarine,6000,3,"Medium cost. Indirect effect taking 3 years as water quality improves. Benefits both carbon storage and habitat."
CONTROL_EROSION,Install Erosion Control,"Install living shorelines, coir logs, or oyster reefs to reduce wave energy and marsh edge erosion.",salt_marsh;tidal_flat,8000,2,"Medium cost. Stabilizes within 2 years. Prevents carbon loss from erosion while creating habitat."
SEED_BROADCAST,Broadcast Native Seeds,"Aerial or manual broadcasting of native seed mixes. Low-intensity intervention for large areas.",salt_marsh;mudflat;transitional_marsh,2500,2,"Low cost compared to transplanting. Takes 2 years for germination and establishment. Weather-dependent success."
THIN_INVASIVE,Thin Invasive Canopy,"Selective removal of invasive woody species to reduce competition. Less intensive than complete removal.",salt_marsh;transitional_marsh,3500,1,"Low-medium cost. Rapid effect (1 year). May need follow-up treatments but less disruptive than full removal."
RESTORE_HISTORIC,Restore Historic Salinity,"Adjust water control structures to restore historic salinity regime. Critical for salt marsh recovery in impounded areas.",impounded_marsh;brackish_marsh,7000,2,"Medium cost. Requires infrastructure modification and monitoring. Vegetation responds within 2 years of salinity shift."
REMOVE_DEBRIS,Remove Marine Debris,"Clean up accumulated debris (logs, wrack, trash) that smothers vegetation and prevents recruitment.",salt_marsh;tidal_flat,1500,0,"Very low cost (labor only). Immediate benefit - allows light and seedling establishment in next growing season."
ADAPTIVE_MANAGE,Adaptive Management,"Ongoing monitoring and adaptive adjustments to restoration actions based on performance. Not a standalone action.",all,1000,0,"Annual cost for monitoring and adaptive responses. Applies to any active restoration scenario. Improves long-term success."
